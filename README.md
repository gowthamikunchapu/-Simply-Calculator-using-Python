# Simply-Calculator-using-Python
This project implements a simple interactive calculator using Python's ipywidgets library. The calculator offers basic arithmetic operations and features, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with utility functions like clear (AC), backspace, and equals to evaluate expressions.
Features:
Interactive Interface: A clean and simple layout built using HBox and VBox from ipywidgets.
Basic Operations:
Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/)
Utility Buttons:
AC (Clear): Resets the input and output fields.
Backspace: Removes the last entered character.
Equals (=): Evaluates the entered expression using Python's eval() function.
Error-Free Input Handling: Backspace and clear functions ensure user control over input mistakes.
